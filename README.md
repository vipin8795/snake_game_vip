# snake_game_vip
 I added a div with the ID playerName to display your name ("Created by: Vipin Prajapati").    2. CSS:  Added styling to #playerName to make it stand out, placing it above the canvas.    3. JavaScript:  No changes were needed in JavaScript. It handles the core game logic (snake movement, fruit spawning, collision detection, etc.).
